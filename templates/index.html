AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term \"artificial intelligence\" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display human cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems. As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. Deep learning, a form of machine learning based on learning data representations as opposed to task-specific algorithms, is a key component of modern artificial intelligence systems. Deep learning relies on neural networks, a class of algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, to process data and learn patterns. The rise of deep learning has enabled significant advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields of AI. Large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT series and Google's LaMDA, use deep learning techniques to generate human-like text based on prompts they are given. These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text generation, translation, and question answering, among other tasks. AI raises concerns about its potential impact on jobs, privacy, and warfare, among other issues. Some experts have expressed concern about the potential for advanced AI systems to cause catastrophic harm if they are not aligned with human values.";
